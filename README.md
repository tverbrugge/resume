https://github.com/tverbrugge/WME_Speed - A Javascript / [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) plugin for the [Waze map editor](https://www.waze.com/editor/).  It can highlight road segments that have various details, such as whether it has certain lock ranks, speed data, house numbers, etc.  It also does some geometric analysis of a segment to determine if it has any irrelevant nodes or nodes that are practically on top of each other.

https://github.com/tverbrugge/spring-cloud-microservice-example First attempt at getting a (currently only 2 layer) Spring microservices achitecture deployed into the cloud. I am using Kubernetes/Docker to deploy to the Google Cloud.  It will do some analysis of the past weather at Denver International Airport. It is forked from an existing repository, but I am making many changes to customize it to my needs.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.troversoft.clickit - An Android app available on the Google Play Store that is based on a simple concept of counting. The goal of the app is to actually break down each count and do some analysis on it.  Despite being seemingly simple, there is much more planned for it.
